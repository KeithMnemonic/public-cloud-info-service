Public Cloud Info Service
=========================

Customers may have their networks configured such that outgoing connections are 
not possible. However, they do want to allow access to our update servers. 
Therefore, customers are interested to get the IP addresses of our 
infrastructure servers to allow traffic to those systems.


Server Design
-------------

All requests must be made via HTTPS. SSL certificate validation is recommended.
HTTP requests will receive a `302 REDIRECT` to an equivalent HTTPS URL.

API:

```
https://susepubliccloudinfo.suse.com/VERSION/FRAMEWORK/REGION/TYPE/DATA-TYPE.FMT
```

Where

VERSION is:

`v1` for the API documented here.

FRAMEWORK is one of:

`amazon`, `google`, `hp` or `microsoft`

REGION is optional, one of the known regions in the cloud framework. Use the 
region identifiers as the provider describes them, for example "us-east-1" in 
Amazon EC2, or "East US 2" in Microsoft Azure.

TYPE is one of:

`servers` or `images`

DATA-TYPE is one of

`smt` or `regionserver` for the servers type

`active`, `deprecated` or `deleted` for the images type


Design decisions for the API
----------------------------

The API flows from generic to specific. The most generic query is for the cloud
framework. More specific is the framework plus either querying server or
image information and so on. When the optional part is omitted we will provide
all information at that level.

For example:

```
https://susecloudinfo.suse.com/v1/microsoft/West%20US/servers/smt.json
```
Will return information about all of our SMT servers running in this region in
Azure in JSON format

```
https://susepubliccloudinfo/v1/amazon/servers/regionserver.xml
```
Will return information about all Region servers in Amazon in all regions in XML
format.

```
https://susepubliccloudinfo/v1/google/images/deprecated.xml
```
Will return information about all deprecated images in Google Compute Engine.

```
https://susepubliccloudinfo.suse.com/v1/hp/images/active.json
```
Will return information about all active images in HP Helion.


Service implementation
----------------------

The service will be implemented using Ruby, Sinatra framework. The data
provided will be driven by XML files, one file per cloud provider. The data
is structured as follows:

```
<framework name="">
  <servers>
    <smt name="" ip="" region=""/>
    <regionserver name="" ip="" region=""/>
  </servers>
  <images>
    <image deletedon="" deprecatedon="" id="" name="" publishedon=""
     region="" replacementid="" replacementname="" state=""/>
  </images>
</framework>
```

The "truth" for this document is in the various cloud frameworks. For Amazon
the tags used as described in the life cycle blog will be used. For Google we
will use the image information provided by the framework. For HP and Microsoft
data will be based on our image naming convention.

The XML file will be generated by a script that queries the various frameworks.
The script runs daily on a VM on our server in Provo.

The information service will return properly formatted XML or JSON data.


Client Implementation
---------------------

We will implement a client in Python based on the same ideas used in
ec2metadata and gcemetadata clients. The client will eventually be included in
our guest images.
